Let  us  now  briefly  consider  the  steps  by  which  domestic races have been 
produced, either from one or from several allied  species.  Some  little  effect  
may,  perhaps,  be attributed to the direct action of the external conditions of 
life, and some little to habit; but he would be a bold man who would account  by  
such  agencies  for  the  differences  of a dray and race horse, a greyhound and 
bloodhound, a carrier and tumbler pigeon. One of the most remarkable features in  
our  domesticated  races  is  that  we see in them adaptation, not indeed to the 
animal's or plant's own good, but to man's use or fancy. Some variations  useful  
to  him  have  probably  arisen  suddenly,  or  by one step; many botanists, for 
instance, believe that the fuller's teazle, with  its  hooks,  which  cannot  be  
rivalled  by any mechanical contrivance, is only a variety of the wild Dipsacus; 
and this amount of change may have suddenly arisen in  a  seedling.  So  it  has  
probably  been  with  the  turnspit dog; and this is known to have been the case 
with the ancon sheep. But when we compare the  dray-horse  and  race-horse,  the  
dromedary  and  camel,  the various breeds of sheep fitted either for cultivated 
land or mountain pasture, with the wool of one breed good for one  purpose,  and  
that  of  another  breed for another purpose; when we compare the many breeds of 
dogs, each good for man in very different ways; when we compare  the  game-cock,  
so  pertinacious  in  battle,  with  other  breeds  so  little quarrelsome, with 
"everlasting layers" which never desire to sit, and with the bantam so small and  
elegant;  when  we  compare  the  host  of  agricultural, culinary, orchard, and 
flower-garden races of plants, most useful to man at different seasons  and  for  
different  purposes, or so beautiful in his eyes, we must, I think, look further 
than to mere variability. We cannot suppose that all the  breeds  were  suddenly  
produced  as perfect and as useful as we now see them; indeed, in several cases, 
we know that this has not  been  their  history.  The  key  is  man's  power  of  
accumulative  selection: nature gives successive variations; man adds them up in 
certain directions useful to him. In this sense he  may  be  said  to  make  for  
himself useful breeds.
